## Research

*My overall research aim is to support the implementation of food production systems that are simultaneously environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable. Within this nexus, my work centres on the welfare of food production animals and complex challenges in agriculture where the needs of all stakeholders, including the public and the animals, need to be understood and accounted for. My doctoral dissertation focused on the welfare of surplus dairy calves and included the use of participatory methods to identify and integrate the needs of farmers, value chain stakeholders, the public, and the animals themselves. My postdoctoral research deepens this focus on calf management to include cow-calf contact dairy systems, and broadens to include other low-value, 'marginalized' animals in food production systems. My research under these themes falls within both the social and natural sciences using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methodologies.*
